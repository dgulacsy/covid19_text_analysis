Shedding more light how people are feeling about the situation by applying sentiment analysis on their tweets' text body. I also carry out explanatory data analysis and text clustering to better understand the topic of the tweets. Some further applications may be to gain some insight on which administrations should make a move as anti-vaccination groups are getting more vigilant on media outlets and starting to organize anti-vaccination protests. But that does not form a part of this work yet."

    "As we can see on each graph there is no clear trend in the sentiment. Their variance change with the frequency but that's just because the average number of tweets included in one time period decreased. However, there are some spikes in the graph, mostly prominently around Oct 13 (maybe some bad news about COVID) and 18 (maybe some good news about COVID) and a remarkable upswing in sentiment at the end of September. As far as preprocessing, these result may better reflect the truth in the underlying data if we could filter out somehow more efficiently those tweets that are highly likely to be posted by bot accounts.
